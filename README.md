I write in mostly python for AI and ML projects. The project building flow goes like follows:

1. Get interested at a random thing.
2. Let it sink in for few days.
3. Revisit and do preliminary research take notes.
4. Check out what people have already built if any.
5. Start building **myself**.
6. Complete documentation based on notes and push.
7. Adios, maybe I'll be back.
