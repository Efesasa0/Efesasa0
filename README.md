**`AI Engineer | Neuroscience Enjoyer`**

Projects that survive my schedule make it to here. I try to document them as best as I can which is the most challenging part. 😅

I write in mostly python for AI and ML projects. The project building flow goes like follows:

1. Get interested at a random thing.
2. Let it sink in.
3. Revisit and do preliminary research take notes.
4. Check out what people have already built if any.
5. Start building myself.
6. Document at the end -> commit
